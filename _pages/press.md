## Research

#### General

I contributed a blog post for [the Digital Initiative at Harvard Business School](https://digital.hbs.edu/) on [the monetization of online disinformation](https://digital.hbs.edu/platforms-crowds/how-brands-unwittingly-fund-disinformation/).

#### Global Disinformation Index

As part of my work at GDI, I am responsible for our ad revenue estimation capabilities from end-to-end. Our most recent report, on the monetization of disinformation in violation of the European Union Code of Conduct, was covered as an exclusive by the [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/5f8a405c-c132-4d9b-a86f-c52884535f3e), and later referenced by [Politico](https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/brussels-playbook/politico-brussels-playbook-stay-home-but-poles-apart-vaccine-info-wars/) and [VICE Magazine](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z3bkz9/google-is-putting-amazon-prime-ads-on-russia-backed-sites-spreading-coronavirus-conspiracies). You can find the full report [on our website](https://disinformationindex.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GDI_Adtech_EU.pdf).


#### Duo
I wrote the survey questions, performed data analysis, and wrote Duo's 2019 [State of the Auth](https://duo.com/blog/the-2019-state-of-the-auth-report-has-2fa-hit-mainstream-yet), a census-representative survey designed to measure adoption and usage of multi-factor authentication. The report was covered in [Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/younger-generations-drive-bulk-of-2fa-adoption/d/d-id/1336581).
I also owned all data analysis and supported content creation for Duo's [2019 Trusted Access Report](https://duo.com/resources/ebooks/the-2019-duo-trusted-access-report). That report was picked up by [ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/2019s-tech-security-and-authentication-trends/), [CSO](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3409785/companies-with-zero-trust-network-security-move-toward-biometric-authentication.html), [Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud/security-snapshot-os-authentication-browser-and-cloud-trends/d/d-id/1335262), [Security Week](https://www.securityweek.com/enterprises-showing-increasing-backing-zero-trust-authentication), and [Infosecurity Magazine](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/businesses-shine-a-light-on-shadow/), among many others (hats off to the PR team). We focused on pillars of the zero-trust security framework.
