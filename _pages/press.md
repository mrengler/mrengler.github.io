## Assembly: Disinformation Fellowship

The Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University curated a "competitively-selected cohort of individuals who work primarily in the private sector, as well as governments and non-profits, to explore emerging problems related to disinformation from a cybersecurity perspective." It is a great privilege to be in [this group](https://www.bkmla.org/fellowship-2020people).

## Notley Fellowship

Notley Ventures, a social impact investment firm based in Austin, has put together a wonderful fellowship program, of which I am honored to be a part. "Bringing together the best and brightest social innovators along with nonprofits and mission based organizations, the Notley Fellowship is designed to prepare and engage our community's rising leaders to solve todayâ€™s most pressing issues." Meet the rest of my cohort [here](https://www.wearenotley.com/fellows-2019-class).

## Crowdstrike Foundation NextGen Scholarship 

I was lucky enough to be one of the inaugural recipients of the Crowdstrike Foundation's NextGen Scholarship, awarded for demonstrating "both an excellent academic record and a strong passion for a career in cybersecurity or AI."
