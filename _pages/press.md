## Research

#### Duo
I wrote the survey questions, performed data analysis, and wrote Duo's 2019 [State of the Auth](https://duo.com/blog/the-2019-state-of-the-auth-report-has-2fa-hit-mainstream-yet), a census-representative survey designed to measure adoption and usage of multi-factor authentication. The report was covered in [Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/application-security/younger-generations-drive-bulk-of-2fa-adoption/d/d-id/1336581).
I also owned all data analysis and supported content creation for Duo's [2019 Trusted Access Report](https://duo.com/resources/ebooks/the-2019-duo-trusted-access-report). That report was picked up by [ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/2019s-tech-security-and-authentication-trends/), [CSO](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3409785/companies-with-zero-trust-network-security-move-toward-biometric-authentication.html), [Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/cloud/security-snapshot-os-authentication-browser-and-cloud-trends/d/d-id/1335262), [Security Week](https://www.securityweek.com/enterprises-showing-increasing-backing-zero-trust-authentication), and [Infosecurity Magazine](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/businesses-shine-a-light-on-shadow/), among many others (hats off to the PR team). We focused on pillars of the zero-trust security framework.
