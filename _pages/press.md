Meet my cohort [here](https://www.notleyfellowship.com/2019-fellows).

#### Crowdstrike Foundation NextGen Scholarship 

I was lucky enough to be one of the inaugural recipients of the Crowdstrike Foundation's NextGen Scholarship, awarded for demonstrating "both an excellent academic record and a strong passion for a career in cybersecurity or AI."
