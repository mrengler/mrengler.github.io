I like to keep track of the books that I read, and list ones that I find especially thought-provoking and relevant here. Though I used [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33780570-maggie) for many years, I've recently switched over to [Bookworm Reads](https://bookwormreads.co/profile/maggie).
