I'm working on fighting platform manipulation at [Twitter](https://twitter/com/). Previously, I led data science development at [Global Disinformation Index](https://disinformationindex.org/) and worked on authentication and modeling user behavior at [Duo Labs](https://duo.com/labs). I'm interested in the online ecosystem: how it's changing us, how we're changing it, and increasingly, the politics and policies that govern it.

I've lived in the Washington D.C. Metro area and the Bay Area, but my home is in Austin, Texas.
