I'm working on fighting disinformation with [Global Disinformation Index](disinformationindex.org) and the [Assembly: Disinformation](https://www.bkmla.org/) group. Previously, I was a data scientist at [Duo Labs](https://duo.com/labs) working on authentication and modeling user behavior. I'm interested in the online ecosystem: how it's changing us, how we're changing it, and increasingly, the politics and policies that govern it.

I've lived in the Washington D.C. Metro area and the Bay Area, but my home is in Austin, Texas.
