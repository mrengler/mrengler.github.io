Right now, I'm working at a startup called [Inflection](https://www.inflection.ai/), helping improve the safety of large language models. I also write a blog called [Safety in Numbers](https://buttondown.email/maggie/archive/) and co-authored [Introduction to Generative AI](https://www.maggieengler.com/book/).

Previously, I fought platform manipulation at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) and taught at the [School of Information](https://ischool.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Austin. Before that, I led data science development at [Global Disinformation Index](https://disinformationindex.org/) and worked on authentication and modeling user behavior at [Duo Labs](https://duo.com/labs). I'm interested in the online ecosystem: how it's changing us, how we're changing it, and the politics and policies that govern it.

I've lived in the Washington D.C. Metro area and the San Francisco Bay Area, but my home is in Austin, Texas.
