I'm working on fighting platform manipulation at [Twitter](https://twitter/com/) and teaching at the [School of Information](https://ischool.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Austin. Previously, I led data science development at [Global Disinformation Index](https://disinformationindex.org/) and worked on authentication and modeling user behavior at [Duo Labs](https://duo.com/labs). I'm interested in the online ecosystem: how it's changing us, how we're changing it, and the politics and policies that govern it.

I've lived in the Washington D.C. Metro area and the San Francisco Bay Area, but my home is in Austin, Texas.

**Right now:** I'm excited to join the [Edgelands Institute](https://www.edgelands.institute/) as a Fellow for the 2022-2023 academic year, and at the iSchool, I'm teaching [Introduction to Human-Centered Data Science](https://www.ischool.utexas.edu/programs/informatics/curriculum/human-centered-data-science).
