Right now, I'm working at [Microsoft AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai), helping improve the safety of large language models. I joined Microsoft from a startup called [Inflection](https://inflection.ai/the-new-inflection). I've also developed a certificate course for [Georgetown University](https://scs.georgetown.edu/academics/professional-certificates/#technology) and co-authored [Introduction to Generative AI](https://www.maggieengler.com/book/).

Previously, I fought platform manipulation at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) and taught at the [School of Information](https://ischool.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Austin. Before that, I led data science development at [Global Disinformation Index](https://disinformationindex.org/) and worked on authentication and modeling user behavior at [Duo Labs](https://duo.com/labs). I'm interested in the online ecosystem: how it's changing us, how we're changing it, and the politics and policies that govern it.

I've lived in the Washington D.C. Metro area and the San Francisco Bay Area, but my home is in Austin, Texas.
